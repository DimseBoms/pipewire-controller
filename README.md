# Pipewire Controller

A small GUI app made for use of Pipewire with Reaper DAW. Reaper has some issues with pipewire, for example, It can't be set to ASLA mode because Pipewire won't let Reaper take control of ALSA and in Jack mode it doesn't have any settings for buffer size of sample rate in Reaper itself.

So what this program is intended to do is simply giving a small GUI for adjusting the most common settings aswell as having the option suspending pipewire to allow Reaper to be run with ALSA.
